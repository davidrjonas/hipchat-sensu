# HipChat / Sensu Addon

This project aims to provide integration of [Sensu] monitoring with [HipChat] chat client.

At this point it isn't even alpha and hasn't been tested against the atlassian
servers. It also has no tests. And this is my first clojure project so it is
bound to be messy.

[HipChat]: http://hipchat.com/
